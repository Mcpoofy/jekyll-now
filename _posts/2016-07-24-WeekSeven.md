**What did I think about the class**

I'll split this section into two portions, the in class portion and the out of class portion, i.e projects, readings, etc.

**In class**

The first part of the class that I would like to talk about is the lecture part of the class. If you didn't know, because it was a summer
class, we met three times a week for an hour and 45 minutes a class, for nine weeks. Now, the first thing I have about the class are 
about the quizzes, or daily quizzes that take up about 18% of your grade for the class. There are two main things about the quizzes.
The first is that the quizzes are for five minutes at the beginning of class. Because I didn't have a class or anything before this, it wasn't a problem
with missing quizzes, but I saw regularly there were people who ran out of time or missed the quizzes because they didn't make it to class in time, so consider
that. The second part is that the quizzes and tests are pretty challenging and rigourous. Based on this class, the average on the first test 
and all of the quizzes were around 70% or lower for both, and this is not including the last test. They are also harder, I would say, then some of the
material he goes over in class, so you really have to know and learn the material if you want to do well. If you want a class that is an easy A or are taking this for 
a grade, I wouldn't recommend taking this class. The lectures themselves were pretty interesting, I would say that most of them are interesting
enough so that you don't get bored or keep staring at a clock to get through the class. Overall, the in class portion was pretty good
and I didn't have that many problems the lectures or going to class, it was very informative. 

**Out of class portion**

There are two main things outside of class, the projects and the readings. I'll get right to the punch, the readings take a decent amount of time
to read and complete and are not a big focus of the class from a grade perspective ( the readings aren't on the test or projects) . There were, maybe, 1-2 questions per week (so 1-2 out of 9-10 questions) about the readings
on the quizzes, and I would also say some of them are guessable. So, if you don't like reading or don't have the time for the readings, you could
probably skip them all with a small effect on your grade if that is preventing you from taking the class, but you are missing out on a lot if you do not read.

The projects are really weird, they are all worth the same but each project has a very large difference in difficulty and easiness. I would say this
classes projects are like a bell curve, the projects start of easy and then get very hard but then end with an easier project. 

I would warn you, that if you are busy a large amount of time or do not have a large amount of time to commit, you shouldn't take this class.
While the easy projects are doable in a "small" amount of time, the larger and harder projects require a large amount of time and the majority of your 
time while you are working on them, and they are also group based. Several members of my group were working on other projects during this time and you do not want to do this,
you end up working 24/7 to complete both projects on time, and have little time to do anything else. 

**End**
Besides that, the projects were pretty interesting and you learn a large amount of information from Downing and the projects, and I would
recommend taking this class if you have the time and energy to spare.
