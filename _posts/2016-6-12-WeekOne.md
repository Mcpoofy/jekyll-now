title: What happened from June 6th to 12th

##What did you do this past week?

  This week I went through the class website and made sure I had everything needed to start and prepare for the class, including purchasing the required books and materials. This week I started the first project in the class , Collatz, which is a project to dip your feet into various programs and tools needed for this class and for future job use.
  
##What's in your way?

  What's in my way right now is that there is currently two large soccer tournaments going on, Euro 2016 and Copa America, which do not help my case for working on the projects and outside work in this class as I like to watch the soccer games in these tournaments. It does not help that I likely acquired a strep throat / cold this week, so I spend more time then I would like resting or napping as a result. Finally, most of the other classes allow phone and laptop use , so I am not used to not having a phone or laptop to look at during class, it will take some getting used to.

##What will you do next week?

  Next week I will likely continue reading the books and papers for the class, and to finish up the collatz project. I might start taking notes on hand as well as relying on the google documents because I feel there is several information that does make it's way to the google document from in the class discussion.
  
##Experience in the class

  I have a bit of social anxiety so class and was sick the first week so class was pretty hard for me. I got pretty nervous and was unprepared on the quizzes so the grades on the quizzes were not what I wanted, but i feel that I can bring them up to par the following week and for the rest of the course. I feel like for a semester long class packed into a nine week course, the work load and hardness of the course will likely increase next week and as we further progress into the course.
