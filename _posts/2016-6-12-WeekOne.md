title: What happened from June 6th to 12th
---

**What did you do this past week?**

  This week I started classes against for the summer session at UT Austin, so it was a transition back to school work from the two week break. 
  
  
  Some of the introduction and required reading's for this class were pretty dry, so it took a while to get through the readings. I also started to solve problems on codeforces again, thanks to the influence of sphere, but I am not very good so the problems are pretty hard and take a while to solve.
  
  
 **What's in your way?**

  What's in my way right now is that there is currently two large soccer tournaments going on, Euro 2016 and Copa America, which do not help my case for working on the projects and outside work in this class as I spend a large amount of time watching the games that go on in the tournaments. It will take some use to getting use to walking to class on hot summer days and not using my phone and computer during class, as I tend to use my phone and laptop for everyday tasks. Finally, I am not used to having to go through all of the steps required for this project so it will take getting used to using Travis CI, Pylint, etc. for a "simple" problem.

**What will you do next week?**

  Next week I will try to continue reading the books and papers for the class, and to finish up the collatz project that is due on Tuesday. I might start taking notes on hand as well as relying on the Google documents because I feel there is several information that does make it's way to the Google document from in the class discussion. I will also try and get ahead in this class so I do not get overloaded all at once.
  
 **Experience in the class**

  I have a bit of social anxiety so class and was sick the first week so class was pretty hard for me. I got pretty nervous answering the questions and was a bit unprepared on the quizzes so the grades on the quizzes were not what I wanted, but I feel that I can bring the scores up to par the following week and for the rest of the course. I feel like for a semester long class packed into a nine week course, the work load and hardness of the course will likely increase very soon so I need to be prepared for that jump.
