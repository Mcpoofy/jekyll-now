title: What happened from June 19th to June 26th

**What did you do this past week?**

This past week has been more "chill" then the other weeks, of the fact we didn't get a third project right away after the finishing the netflix project. Instead, we have a test, which I say is less labor extensive then the project, but that might be a mistake. Going into more detail, I finished the Netflix project
and intro to security projects this week. The netflix project took a while to finish, and started to become really frustrating after a while. I kept getting results that were .02 to .05 away from the .99 requirement, so when I finally got down to .98, it felt pretty good. Im still concerned about the the acceptance and others acceptance tests though.

**What's in your way?**

We have a test on Monday, so that's in my way right now. Besides that, Fourth of July is coming up in a week and I'm leaving to go back home Friday, so I have to not get lazy until then. I'm pretty previous about the test though, considering 80-90% will be coding. Looking back at the material, its hard to tell what exactly is codable and will be tested on the test.
I also have to start and finish the cheat sheet. 

**What will you do next week?**

Well, until Monday's test I will probably be finishing up and continuing to study, but after that the project is released. All I know about this particular assignment is that its grouped and scaled over 3 projects, so I don't know what to initially expect for project 3.
I think the project is in group's of sixes, so it might be hard to find a schedule that fits everyone in the group.

**Experience in the class**

I'm starting to get the format of the quizzes down, so that's going to be a good thing. Some of the questions on the quizzes in the past week were pretty tricky, but after looking back at them I felt they were fair. It's probably best to play around with examples in python from the past class before you take the quiz over that material.
